## First Assignment - Prolog Application for a Board Game

### Description of Board Game - Pente

#### Origin
Pente is a strategy board game created by Gary Gabrel in 1977. Gary was a dishwasher at Hideaway Pizza, a restaurant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Customers played Pente at this restaurant while waiting for their order. The game is based off a Japanese game called gomoku. Both are played in a 19x19 Go board with white and black stones.
